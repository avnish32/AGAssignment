Landscape created using landmass plugin.

1 Nov - Procedural color applied using dot product of vertex normal and z axis.
1 Nov - Procedural texture applied using material layer and material layer blends. Alpha for layer blends calculated using aforementioned dot product.

2 Nov - Added lanndscape grass output. It uses 5 grass SMs, and is connected to the blend function b/w grass and soil material layers.
2 Nov - Added procedurally generated trees using procedural foliage spawner. This takes in static mesh foliages and generates them based on some rules such as ground slope, number of steps, how many seeds to spread on each step, how far seeds should be spread, collision radius etc.
2 Nov - Another procedural foliage spawner volume was added for twigs.

3 Nov - Added weather change events that can be called from editor.
3 Nov - Added smooth atmospheric transition
3 Nov - Added functionality to toggle rain. Only landscape material becomes wet using a material parameter collection and atmosphere gets darker; raindrops and thunder are yet to be implemented.
3 Nov - Added raindrops and splashes using collision events in niagara system. (splash.png taken from transparentpng.com)

4 Nov - Added thunder vfx by dynamically offsetting material opacity mask (thunder png taken from pngimg.com)
4 Nov - Added mechanism for lightning to strike at random locations but always facing the player.
4 Nov - Added another texture for lightning, now texture will be chosen randomly. Created BP for rain and added SFX for rain and thunder. (SFX taken from mixkit.co).

5 Nov - Added outwardly spreading ripple effect to rain niagara system. Used 'scale sprite size' in Niagara to increase size. Unchecked 'update attribute initial values' in event handler to make it work after wanting to gouge my eyes out for 2 hours. (Ripple normal map taken from fabianklingl.artstation.com)
5 Nov - Added puddle using decal material. Added ripples in puddle by panning 2 copies of the same normal map in opposite directions. (Puddle ripple normal map taken from textures.pixel-furnace.com)
5 Nov - Added outwardly splashing particles when raindrops hit the ground instead of the billboard splash texture.
5 Nov - Integrated rain and thunder with weather system. Terrain now smoothly transitions from wet to dry and vice-versa. Handled button smashing case too for this - in case user toggles rain before ground is completely wet, it starts getting dry from from current state, now from fully wet state.

6 Nov - Added movement of directional light based on time of day.
	time of day mappings:
	time	directionalLightYAxisAngle (Pitch)
	0	90
	6	180
	12	270
	18	360
6 Nov - Added smooth transition for rain
6 Nov - Added moonlight.
6 Nov - Tweaked sunlight to masquerade as moonlight so clouds are visible at night, by adjusting sun's rotation, intensity and color when it is nighttime. Hence deleted additional direction light serving as moonlight.

7 Nov - Added actual moon mesh and set its position to be opposite to that of sun. Night light is still provided by a single directional light, but it is now occluded by the moon mesh. The mesh is a child of BP_TimeOfDay. Since now rotation of the parent BP is always the same as directional light's, and the moon's position is offset wrt the sun's, moon will always be on the opposite end of the sun's orbit.

7 Nov - Added stars using Niagara hanging particle system, fixed do once bug in Increment Time function. Do Once works properly only within the scope of the function.  Replaced it with a static flag.

8 Nov - Added a separate dir light for moon and smoothened day/night transition by freezing rotation of sun/moon for half an hour at dusk/dawn respectively.

13 Nov - Added particle system for blowing twigs that are affected by wind speed. Also mapped wind speed to grass and trees.

15 Nov - Messed around with PCG, added volcano mesh and a stupid looking explosion.

16 Nov - Somehow added some smoke and explosions to the volcano and added custom event for testing. It needs polishing.

17 Nov - Added internal and oozing lava, added oozing out effect by offsetting material opacity mask and updating its offset from an external, parent scene component.

18 Nov - Made lava rise upon eruption - used finterp to constant for this, updated z value of location and opacity of both the internal lava and the internal lava decal. Also added volcano wetness with rain.
18 Nov - Enhanced wind system to affect rain and puddle ripples.

19 Nov - Puddle size and scene wetness is now affected by rain duration. Grass wetness is also affected but isn't really visible.
19 Nov - Enabled remote control API. Exposed weather presets, rain strength and wind speed.
19 Nov - Added camera shake on volcano eruption and reset volcano functionality.

20 Nov - Added functionality to convert time of day into hours, mins and secs. Also added switch to toggle automatic time of day progression. Time of day was also exposed to remote control web app. Hours, mins and secs are being displayed in the app but not updated. Might be because the API call that unreal makes when user manually updates the exposed property is not being made when same properties are updated at runtime through blueprint. The only quick fix I can think of is to display earth time on the UI.

21 Nov - Added manual lightning strike functionality. Added relevant toggle and button for the same in Remote Control UI.

22 Nov - Added clock on HUD. Digital clock font by David J Patterson downloaded from https://www.dafont.com/alarm-clock.font.
22 Nov - Smmothened the day/night transition by lerping over the light intensities and setting the forward shading priorities based on intensities in the twilight hours.
22 Nov - Added time of day presets - noon, midnight, sunrise and sunset. Fixed associated bug where stars did not disappear when user went from midnight -> noon (before stars could fade out completely) -> midnight -> noon.
22 Nov - While trying to add camera presets, encountered a bug where camera location was not being updated on RC UI when user clicked on a preset. This resulted in cam position changing again when user tried to adjust it using joystick. Used HTTP requests to fix this. A PUT request is made at beginPlay and whenever user clicks on cam preset, to update values on UI. Need to implement the same for cam rotation and time of day.
