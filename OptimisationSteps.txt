Enabled nanite on landscape.

On Directional light and moon light
Dynamic Shadow distance Movable Light - 20000 -> 5000
Distance Field Shadows activated and distance set to 100,000.

Mobilities changed as appropriate.
Affect Distance Field lighting disabled for Rocks, grass, twigs, seedlings.

Trees texture LOD bias increased so texture resolution is 2K. No improvement observed.
Dynamic shadow cascades set from 4 to 2, but no impact observed, hence was set back to 4.
Shadow resolution on directional lights was reduced from 1 to 0.5. No improvement.
Lumen was disabled in Project settings -> Engine -> Rendering -> Dynamic global illumination method and Reflection method. Around 4 FPS were gained.
Lumen was enabled back after deleting PCG volumes, FPS were found to be the same, so Lumen was left on.

Commands/tools used:
stat fps - shows FPS
trace.file - writes trace to a file
trace.stop - stops the trace
Unreal Insights to analyse the .utrace file

Note: Nanite was turned off on flowers as no significant performance improvement was observed. So there are no trace files for that stage.
